OVERVIEW
---------

This package is a general, robot-agnostic implementation of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs).  A good reference on DMPs can be found at: http://www-clmc.usc.edu/publications/P/pastor-ICRA2009.pdf
 
 
This package has been modified by Ángel Poc López for developing his master thesis "A Learning from Demonstration Approach for Robot Trajectories through Motion-Sensing Human Demonstrations"
